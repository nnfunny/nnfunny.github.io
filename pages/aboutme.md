Hello everyone :blush:,

How are you going today? 

I am Nam Nguyen. I come from Vietname. I am currently an international student in Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia. 

I am an avid web developer, and I am interested in reading books.

To pursue my passion of becoming a software engineer, I never stop putting all my effort to every personal project. This blog is one of my practical projects.

Anyway, thanks for visting my page
