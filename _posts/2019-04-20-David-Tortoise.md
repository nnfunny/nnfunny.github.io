A tortoise whose name is David lives in the style befitting a gentlemen as well as an avid reader. He is such a nice guy. He usually wallows to read interesting books and help people in trouble, especially they are poor and elderly. He always follows a statement: no matter who people are, never underestimate they because all individuals on the Earth influence their existence each other, and it is impossible for an individual to exist independently on this planet. He always avoids being an example of a fickle friend who is a person changing their mind suddenly in an unreasonable way, so he always have highly perceptive comments to notice things that everyone cannot see and understand quickly as he does. Due to his excellent behavior as always, he deliberately helped an elderly man, who is a president of the biggest city in Happy city, to cross the road and gave him a lovely hug as well as a beam. Therefore, he got an all-expenses-paid trip to MOON city, the most modern and biggest city around the world, from the president.
