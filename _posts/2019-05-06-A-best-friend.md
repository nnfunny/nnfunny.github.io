A little bearâ€™s name is Ruf, and he lives in a country whose name is Unicorn. His major is Computer Science and he wants to be a web developer in the future, so he cannot avoid being sedentary. To reduce the amount of time sitting in front of computer and keep his body fit, every 20 minutes he forces himself to stand up and does small excercises that he learned from Youtube videos. 
He is an international student in Rainbow - a country is famous for higher education, and I am studying at Galaxy University. Like all other international students, he feels highly homesick from his parents to his friends. He would talk deeply into his friends in Vietnam. He has one female friend, Loria. She is my best friend. She confides in and shares everything happening to her with me everyday. She is super valued to me because she is often by my side whenever he encounters the tough weeks. They have similar interests, ideas and even clothes style, so they are a compatible couple. Nothing becomes a hindrance that can screw up their friendship. 
Sometimes, he looks at the sky at night and tries to find out Celestial Bodies without any kinds of telescope that makes him feel better after hard-working days.
