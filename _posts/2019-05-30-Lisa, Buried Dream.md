A younger woman whose name is Lisa is working in a consulting company. She appears with a long blond hair, blue deep eyes and slim shape, plus the graceful physical attraction. Honestly, she is beautiful and considered as a version two of Liza Soberano from Philippines. However, this beauty has been buried in the ground for a long time after the first time she started being hired by a model company was considered as the last time she did as her parent do not allowed her to pursue model career.  Therefore, she is currently working in the company from dawn to dusk with a measly salary, and the worse thing is that her eyes have to stick on the screen 8 hours straight. She sometimes wonders whether she is letting her time pass through her life meaninglessly and accepting the sustain life with walking-dead daily body. 

One day, she would be responsible for hosting a pivotal meeting where her boss was going to deal with a big partner in a cost-highly project. She felt overwhelmed like a lot of rocks were being pressed down on her shoulder under the constant pressure. If she had not done it well, she would have got fired and her company could have lost a big opportunity working with one of huge partners on the competitive market. The day before the meeting officially day was the testing day on her work after her 10-day preparation. Her boss scrutinized carefully her organization, performance and report she had virtually spent her all night writing that she had been half-asleep then. Unfortunately, in the middle of her presentation, she fumbled helplessly for words, and she stopped finding the right words to say that she just had forgotten them in a while. Not that she got compliment from her boss obviously. On the meeting day, she tried her best and ended with a bang that was a good sign of lucky as well as the existence of the God. Her work had been done well. While her boss was dealing with the partner, she slipped out of the room without being paid someone’s attention as at that time her boss did not need her to do him any favour. Then, she headed to convenience store and bought the most expensive ice cream for herself as a gift of hosting a successful meeting, and then continued daydreaming about the model career on the cloud 9 that it had been perceived as her “intangible” dream she have never ever approach in her own way due to family… Such dream is something intangible until we completely start to pursue it.
