Rosie and Sarah are two lovely butterflies. They are best friends each other, but their personalities are completely different. Since Rosie is more beautiful with her splendid wings than Sarah, but Rosie is reputation for arrogance, and Sarah is timid and meek but graceful in treating to other people even in difficult situations. One day, two little girls glided to a beautiful garden of flowers, and then gathered nectar as usual. Unfortunately, a ugly big mantis jumped on their flower and then attacked them. Luckily, although she is not as gorgeous as Rosie, she is smart and usually observe everything around her while she was gathering nectar in case any kinds of enemy was going to attack her, and she could protect herself and her friend on time. Differently, before they almost had got attacked, Rosie commenced to gather nectar without being alert dangers surrounded her. She has a beauty in term of physical attraction, but her beauty of soul and mind cannot compare with her friend, Sarah because Rosie will be absolutely a loser if there is a comparison of their “real and permanent beauty”.
