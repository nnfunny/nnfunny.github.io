Len is a sixteen-year-old boy, and he possesses a supernatural power which totally hypnotizes someone in 2 seconds and even badly turns them into a state of a puppet. 

Tom was his best friend. One day, he found Len acting weirdly and doing some magic at the back of school, so he was intrigued to follow him during the break time. Amazingly, Tom witnessed his supernatural power that controlled a dog trying to climb a tall tree. Unfortunately, he caught Tom’s eyes looking at what he had done, so Tom had his heart in his mouth, but he demanded Tom to promise to keep Len’s power in secret. The following days, they had become best friends each other.

Unfortunately, the supernatural power is a doubled-edged sword because of his young age that he was not able to control the potential danger of overwhelming power. The accident caused by his power happened when they went home after school while it was drizzling outside with a gloomy sky. Due to the bad weather, they sprinted to reach the bus stop next to their school 500 meter away to the left side. While they were waiting for the bus, Len noticed that there were two tall big guys lurking them behind the bus stop and tending to do something bad on his friend. A couple of minutes later, he realized that these guys were immoral students who often bullied his friend at school – Tom often told Len all bullying stories in a hurting feeling. However, he hadn’t predicted what these guys was going to do with his friend. Somehow, his shoelace was untied, so he lowered his body and used his hand to tie it in a couple of seconds, but suddenly one of these guys who reeked of tobacco pounced on his friend from behind, wrapping his right arm all the way around Tom’s neck to his left bicep, and pressing down Tom’s head with his left hand. Their faces were pure concentration and aggression, while Len’s eyes were wide with shock and fear. Then, they asked Len to give them money. Otherwise, they would push down his friend’s face to dog mug as they were holding Tom’s head above the pile of much. Without hesitation, he decided to use his power to save his friend but not in a calm state. Unconsciously, he validated his power on his friend and controlled him to move forward the street. In confused state, he could not stop his friend from stepping out, so a truck with the high speed hit Tom and crushed his face severely. Then, Len ran forward to his friend, cuddled him and cried out loud. From this day, he had lived in regret that he was not able to stop his friend’s footsteps in the nick of the time. He hates his power. At the end of the day, he suicided by jumping down from the 100-floor building to have a chance of meeting Tom in “the reflection of the world” and apologizing him for his incompetence of his power.
