Sometimes, she wondered why they discriminated her because she was both motherless and fatherless. Fortunately, she found her real passion and pleasure in her life. She loves writing novels. She wrote a lot of funny stories in high schools, and thanks to her hobbies she had good friends. After graduating from high school, she started serious career of writing novels.
