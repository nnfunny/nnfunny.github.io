Charlotte is a freshman at Vanilla University. She often looks pretty in a denim dungaree dress and white blouse, plus a short blond hair and blue deep eyes that boys notice her as they pass through her.

She had pursued wholeheartedly the hospitality industry at the first place before she considered that she'd been having a qualm about choosing the wrong major. Why this thought came to her mind? One day, she'd headed to a design competition with her best friend, who was studying digital design at Artie University as the day before she had been invited to come along with her to the competition for fun, so she had decided to dabble in this competition to support and give some feedbacks on her friend's final product even though she had no idea about the art. However, her feedback was fully valuable and contributed a lot to her friend's first prize. After that, she went home and thought of her support, and she gradually realized that she was interested in art, especially digital art. On the following day, she discussed the swich in her study with her family, and fortunately they accepted her decision without hestitation as they respected their daughter as long as she would be fulfilled whole life. Therefore, she had quitted the Vanilla University, and then got an offer from the same university as her best friend. 

The days have gone by, the more she studies about art, the more eclectic her mindset is. This behooves her to bounce up and down in the colorful world of creativity. That's why her desgins have been highly appriciated by the top professors in art industry, which makes him be over the moon. She have definitely had a whale of a time for one year as a second-time freshman at a new environment.
