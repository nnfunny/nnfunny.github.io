A small meek worm lives on a beautiful flower in a big guy’s garden. Most of worms treat other animals violently and immorally, but the cute worm is not corrupted by these worms and always follow a moral life that is willing to help any kinds of animals, no matter how who they are as long as they are not going to treat him like an ass. One day that fell in the interval between two trimester of his college, it was a beautiful weather, but it was a nightmare to him, and he was bullied by a ground of worm gangsters. As usual, he was totally meek and didn’t take any action against anyone, even they deliberately crushed him, but he stood up and take grit to throw into and oppose them as an evil in his soul was summoned to attack them cruelly. These guys were being scared of his rage, and then they ran away immediately. After that, this small worm kept calm and returned a meek state as uasal. Seriously, he almost replicated from the image of Micky Ward, an American former professional boxer.
