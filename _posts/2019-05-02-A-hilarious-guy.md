I live in an isolated area placed in Western Australia. One day, while I was walking on the narrow track leading to my home, my friend, Wallie, jumped out from a big and splendid tree under the light of the moon, and startled me. I completely had my heart in my month. He always come with beaming a warm smile that makes me feel better and comfortable after hard working, and I did the same thing on that day. On the way to our homes, he would get home before me, so he tried to utilize our time to make as many jokes as he could. He knew that I was exhausted, and he wanted to get me out of stress, so he did that all time. I highly appreciated it. 

Also, he is my best friend, and he never deliberately misleads me into any kinds of the wrong mindset or hoax. Sometimes, he makes fun of me, and it is quite impolite and out of the control, but I know he has no offence on it, so my face is never dark with rage. Instead, we laugh a lot at his joke together. We often call each other by aliases such as Bean, Dump, and Booger.
